# Sinatra Url Shortener With Users

## Learning Competencies

## Summary

 Let's integrate our URL shortener with our user authentication code.  This will let people save the URLs they've shortened and open up the possibility of "private" short URLs.

This will be the most complex web application you've worked on so far; take it one step at a time.  If the problem seems unassailable, break it down into simpler parts you understand.  If you don't see how to break it down, flag down a staff member and ask: "How do I break this down into something that makes more sense for me?"

## Learning Goals

- Continued learning about ActiveRecord associations.
- Learn how to integrate two pieces of code into one coherent application.
- Explore a minimalistic authorization scheme to protect certain pages in a web application from being viewed by unauthorized persons.

## Objectives

### Glue together!

Start by gluing together your user authentication code and your URL shortening code as best you can.  This means creating the relevant migrations, models, and controller code.

The core flow of the URL shortener should remain the same, however a person might choose to log in or create an account.  In the event that they're logged in when they shorten a URL, this `Url` should now be associated with their user account.  In other words, a `Url` belongs to a `User` and a `User` has many `Urls`.

**Note**: Don't worry about implement the above user-centric logic yet.  First get all the URL shortening and user authentication code working.  Make sure people can log in and can shorten URLs regardless of whether they're logged in or not.

In this case, you might want multiple controllers.  Something like this would be reasonable:

1. `app/controllers/urls.rb`, which contains the routes related to listing, creating, and redirecting `Url` objects
2. `app/controllers/sessions.rb`, which contains the routes related to logging in and logging out
3. `app/controllers/users.rb`, which contains the routes related to creating, displaying, and editing users

### Logged in, logged out, and current user

People should be able to create short URLs regardless of whether they're logged in or not.  That is, the `user_id` field on the `urls` table could possible be `NULL`.

However, if a user *is* logged in, when we create a URL it should set the `user_id` to whatever the `user_id` of the currently logged-in user is.  This information *should not* be a part of the form that a user submits &mdash; it would be trivial for someone to change the content of the form and submit as any user.

Instead, create a users helper at `app/helpers/user.rb`.  It should contain a method that works like this:

```ruby
helpers do
  # This will return the current user, if they exist
  # Replace with code that works with your application
  def current_user
    if session[:user_id]
      @current_user ||= User.find_by_id(session[:user_id])
    end
  end

  # Returns true if current_user exists, false otherwise
  def logged_in?
    !current_user.nil?
  end
end
```

Your controller can now call `current_user` to get the currently authenticated user, if they exist.  This means we don't have to rely on user-submitted data to determine what user created a short URL.

### Profile Page

Create a profile page for each user like so:

```ruby
get '/users/:id' do
end
```

This should display all the links that a particular user has created.  If I'm viewing my *own* profile page, show the number of clicks next to each link so I can see how awesome my link-sharing skills are.
